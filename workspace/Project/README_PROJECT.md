# Wander / Drift — Project Overview

## Scope
This Unity project hosts the playable side-scrolling world for Wander / Drift. The
focus is on the auto-walk ritual, gentle drift events, and calm discovery moments
that reinforce a community-first tone.

## Pillar Summary
- Magical Walk: slow, atmospheric presence with player-paced nudges.
- Drift: poetic, non-punishing shifts in time and direction.
- Discovery: endless micro-variation in biomes and encounters.
- Community World: shared milestones with optional social touchpoints.
- Memory & Proof: world history recorded in a view-only archive.

## Immediate Next Tasks
1) Wire the Bootstrap scene to a minimal GameObject graph.
2) Sketch ScriptableObject schemas for chunks and encounters.
3) Draft placeholder prefabs for chunk streaming tests.
