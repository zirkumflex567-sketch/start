# Wander / Drift - Game Context

## One-line concept
A living side-scrolling pixel world where the character auto-walks and the world
occasionally "drifts" time and direction, with a calm, community-first tone.

## Pillars
- Magical Walk: slow, atmospheric, ritual-like presence.
- Drift: unpredictable, poetic, never punishing.
- Discovery: endless micro-variation in biomes, encounters, and moments.
- Community World: shared milestones and quiet co-creation.
- Memory & Proof: world history recorded in a view-only archive.
- Customization: expression grows over time, no gameplay advantage.
- Optional Social: quiet, safe, opt-in only.

## Non-negotiables
- No death, no hard fail state.
- No competition, no FOMO.
- No in-game leaderboards.
- Nothing shouts, everything whispers.
- Assets are in-house or properly licensed with attribution.

## Core loop (MVP)
- Auto-walk to the right; player gently changes pace.
- Camera pan within a soft radius; smooth snap-back.
- Random drift events: pre-drift > onset > reverse > afterglow.
- Small encounters: animals, NPCs, moments, treasure.
- Campfire mode for ambient viewing (optional).

## Archive (web, view-only)
- Not playable, only a record of world history.
- Scrollable timeline with key moments and totals.
